jwz and Hallvard made major changes and additions to the bytecode
interpreter.

The following instructions were added:
@itemize
@item @code{mult} (97)
@item @code{forward-char} (117)
@item @code{forward-word} (118)
@item @code{skip-chars-forward} (119)
@item @code{skip-chars-backward} (120)
@item @code{forward-line} (121)
@item @code{char-syntax} (122)
@item @code{buffer-substring} (123)
@item @code{delete-region} (124)
@item @code{narrow-to-region} (125)
@item @code{widen} (126)

@item @code{concatN} (176)
@item @code{insertN} (177)
@end itemize

Instruction @code{unbind-all} was added to support tail-recursion
removal.  However this was never subsequently implemented; so this
intruction was never generated.

Starting in this version, unless C prepocessor variable
@code{BYTE_CODE_SAFE} (off by default) is defined, the obsolete
instructions listed in 18.59 are not implemented.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:
@verbatim
;;; compiled by rms@psilocin.gnu.ai.mit.edu on Mon Jun 10 17:37:37 1996
;;; from file /home/fsf/rms/e19/lisp/bytecomp.el
;;; emacs version 19.31.2.
;;; bytecomp version FSF 2.10
;;; optimization is on.
;;; this file uses opcodes which do not exist in Emacs 18.
@end verbatim


@node After 19.34 and Starting in 20.1
@section After 19.34 and Starting in 20.1

There were no instruction changes. However bytecode interpretation of
@code{read-char}, which became obsolete in v19 was dropped.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:
@verbatim
;;; Compiled by rms@psilocin.gnu.ai.mit.edu on Sun Aug 31 13:07:37 1997

@end verbatim


@node After 20.1 and Starting in 21.4
@section Ater 20.1 and Starting in 21.4

There were no instruction changes. However there were major
changes in the bytecode interpreter.

An instruction with opcode 0 causes an abort.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:
@verbatim
;;; Compiled by pot@pot.cnuce.cnr.it on Tue Mar 18 15:36:26 2003

@end verbatim

@node After 21.1 and Starting in 22.1
@section After 21.1 and Starting in 22.1

There were no instruction changes.

The bytecode meta-comment no longer includess the bytecomp version used.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:

There were no instruction changes.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:

@end verbatim

@node After 23.1 and Starting in 24.1
@section After 23.1 and Starting in 24.1

The following instructions were added:
@itemize
@item @code{stack-set}   (178)
@item @code{stack_set2}, (179)
@item @code{discardN}, (180)
@end itemize

The following instructions became obsolete:

@unnumberedsubsec @code{save-current-buffer} (97)

Is replaced by @code{byte-save-current-buffer} (114)

Unless C prepocessor variable @code{BYTE_CODE_SAFE} (off by default) is
defined, obsolete instructions below and from earlier versions are not implemented.

@itemize
@item @code{temp-output-buffer-setup} (144)
@item @code{temp-output-buffer-show} (145)
@item @code{save-window-excursion} (139)
@end itemize

Instruction @code{unbind-all}, which never was generated, was marked obsolete
in this version.

The bytecode meta-comment no longer who user/hostname compiled and at what time.
A message indcating whether utf-8 non-ASCII characters is used is included.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:
@verbatim
;;; from file /misc/emacs/bzr/emacs24-merge/lisp/emacs-lisp/bytecomp.el
;;; in Emacs version 24.3
;;; with all optimizations.

;;; This file uses dynamic docstrings, first added in Emacs 19.29.

;;; This file does not contain utf-8 non-ASCII characters,
;;; and so can be loaded in Emacs versions earlier than 23.
@end verbatim

@node After 24.1 and Starting in 25.1
@section After 24.1 and Starting in 25.1

Instruction 0 becomes an error rather than aborting emacs.

A number of changes were made to @code{bytecode.c}.

The following instructions were added:
@itemize
@item @code{ophandler} (48)
@item @code{conditioncase} (49)
@item @code{pushcondition} (50)
@end itemize

The following obsolete instructions as of v18 can no longer can be interpreted:
@itemize
@item @code{scan-buffer} (107)
@item @code{set-mark} (115)
@end itemize

You will get an error if @code{BYTE_CODE_SAFE} is defined.

The bytecode meta-comment no longer include the source-code path.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:
@verbatim
;;; Compiled
;;; in Emacs version 25.2
;;; with all optimizations.

;;; This file uses dynamic docstrings, first added in Emacs 19.29.

;;; This file does not contain utf-8 non-ASCII characters,
;;; and so can be loaded in Emacs versions earlier than 23.
@end verbatim

@node After 25.1 and Starting in 26.1
@section After 25.1 and Starting in 26.1

The following instruction was added:
@itemize
@item @code{switch} (267)
